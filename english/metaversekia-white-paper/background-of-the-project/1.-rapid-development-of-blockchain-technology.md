The mediating role played by blockchain allows artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things to be better utilized, becoming the driving technology of the fourth industrial revolution and completely subverting traditional finance. Currently, we are in the blockchain 3.0 stage, which is a stage where blockchain technology transcends currency and economy, and is applied in more fields. At this stage, technology empowers the real economy, and blockchain technology moves from "concept" to "value implementation" and from "niche" to "public".
