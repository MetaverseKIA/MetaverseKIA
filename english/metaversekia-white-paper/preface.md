# 1️⃣ Preface

The world of blockchain is an area full of innovation and change. In this world, decentralization is the core principle, and data is stored on many nodes in a distributed manner, ensuring that information cannot be tampered with and is highly secure. It breaks the traditional centralized trust model and allows people to conduct trusted interactions and transactions without the need for third-party intermediaries. The emergence of smart contracts enables various complex business logic to be automatically executed, greatly improving efficiency and reducing costs. People can create their own digital assets on the blockchain and freely circulate and trade them through the blockchain network. The world of blockchain has also spawned numerous application scenarios, from digital currency and cross-border payments in the financial field to traceability management in the supply chain field, from digital copyright protection to the construction of decentralized autonomous organizations. It brings new opportunities and possibilities to various industries and promotes innovation in business models and social governance. At the same time, the world is also facing many challenges, such as the continuous upgrading and improvement of technology, the adaptation of regulatory policies, and the response to security risks. But it is undeniable that the world of blockchain is attracting more and more people to join in with its unique charm and potential to explore and open up a new future. It is like a new digital continent full of infinite possibilities, waiting for people to discover and create. The emergence of the KIA public chain means that it will bring a new decentralized original universe interconnected world. This will be the latest revolutionary product of the current society, and the KIA metaverse will also belong to all mankind. Most people think that the world of blockchain is decentralized, but blockchain is divided into three parts: public chain, alliance chain, and private chain. However, only the public chain is absolutely decentralized, and the alliance chain is effective. Decentralization, but not true decentralization, is semi-decentralization: compared with public chains, its degree of decentralization is slightly weaker. Private chains are under centralized control: usually owned and managed by a specific organization or institution, which has strong control over the permissions and rules on the chain. In traditional life commercial APPs, assuming that if you use a consortium chain, your data cannot be tampered with, but you can also control your account. To achieve true decentralization, you still have to rely on a public chain. But if everything is truly decentralized and becomes anonymous, once ecological applications are artificially damaged, no one can find the saboteur, so this is also a major problem for ecological applications. Therefore, KIA understands the limitations of blockchain more clearly and inspires us to find new ways to overcome these limitations, thereby promoting the development of technology. The so-called logic of making simple things complicated and making complicated things simple. So the KIA public chain was born. In the world of the KIA public chain, everyone will be a builder, developer and user. The KIA public chain will belong to everyone in the world, realizing the logic of one account traveling the world, which can not only achieve true decentralization, but also It can ensure the double guarantee of user information security.
