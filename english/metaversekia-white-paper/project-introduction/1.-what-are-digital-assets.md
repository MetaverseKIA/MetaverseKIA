# 1. What are digital assets?

Digital assets refer to non-monetary assets owned or controlled by an enterprise that exist in the form of electronic data and are held for sale or in the production process during daily activities. Broadly defined digital assets refer to assets in the form of electronic data owned or controlled by individuals and enterprises, which are held in daily activities to exchange or exercise corresponding physical assets. Digital assets in the narrow sense specifically refer to computer programs (tokens) registered on the blockchain distributed ledger, which can be programmed, and the exchange between assets is the exchange of code and code.
