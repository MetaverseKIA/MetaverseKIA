# 2. What is blockchain

Blockchain is a new application model of computer technology such as distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanism, and encryption algorithm. The so-called consensus mechanism is a mathematical algorithm that establishes trust and obtains rights and interests between different nodes in the blockchain system. It is essentially a decentralized database and serves as the underlying technology of the token. The blockchain is a series of data blocks generated using cryptographic methods. Each data block contains information about a Bitcoin network transaction and is used to verify the validity of its information (anti-counterfeiting) and generate the next block. In a narrow sense, blockchain is a chained data structure that combines data blocks in a sequential manner in chronological order, and is a cryptographically guaranteed distributed ledger that cannot be tampered with or forged. Broadly speaking, blockchain technology uses block chain data structures to verify and store data, uses distributed node consensus algorithms to generate and update data, uses cryptography to ensure the security of data transmission and access, and uses automated scripts to A new distributed infrastructure and computing method that uses smart contracts composed of codes to program and operate data.
